"The Art of Living"

chords for soprano ukulele https://github.com/lynn/ukulele

The song is in F# major, so let's tune down a semitone and play in G on the ukulele.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

        0222    0202   0002    5555
Intro:  Gmaj7   Em7    Cmaj7   F6

The same chords go over the verse, but slower:

    Gmaj7                       Em7
    Cherry trees in bloom, view from my living room
    Cmaj7     F6
    Remind me
    ...
    (x4)

The last time, play F13 [2315] instead of F6. Then, the little "chorus" goes:

    0211
    Gm7
    To view the rest up close
          2010
          F
    Feels deeper than the most

Then repeat the intro over "Where it started, where it started..."

Outro: linger on F13 for a bit and resolve to Gmaj7.

Note: If F13 is hard on your fingers, F7 [2313] is fine too.
